{"prompt": "Implement A* with an admissible heuristic to find the 1-th element in expected linear time; support custom key functions and stability requirements where applicable. Use type hints throughout (PEP 484) and include docstrings. Include a small benchmark harness using time.perf_counter(). Also include a regression test for scenario ID PY-86254.", "language": "python"}
{"prompt": "Implement DP for knapsack with reconstruction with idiomatic iterators and zero-copy parsing where possible; include benchmarks with criterion. Include tests with tokio::test where async is involved and proptest for invariants. Public API must be safe; isolate unsafe blocks with explicit safety invariants. Include a regression test for case RUST-47896.", "language": "rust"}
{"prompt": "Build a configuration component: shared memory message framing; include careful error handling with std::error_code and unit tests. Provide a minimal CMakeLists.txt and unit tests (Catch2 or GoogleTest). Include a fuzz target skeleton (libFuzzer) for API robustness. Add a test case labeled CPP-66789 to prevent regressions.", "language": "c++"}
