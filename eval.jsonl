Also include a regression test for scenario ID PY-15100.", "language": "python"}
{"prompt": "Implement Dijkstra with binary heap + adjacency list with idiomatic iterators and zero-copy parsing where possible; include benchmarks with criterion. Use Rust 2021 edition; follow clippy recommendations. Public API must be safe; isolate unsafe blocks with explicit safety invariants. Include a regression test for case RUST-23389.", "language": "rust"}
{"prompt": "Build a rate limiter middleware using channels/atomics: ensure thread safety, avoid deadlocks, and explain Send/Sync bounds. Add structured error handling (thiserror/anyhow) and tracing instrumentation. Public API must be safe; isolate unsafe blocks with explicit safety invariants. Include a regression test for case RUST-53609.", "language": "rust"}

{"prompt": "Create a config loader utility: supports env+file overrides and validation; use anyhow/thiserror, structured logging, and config parsing.
